        Extract relational features from appearance feature and geometric feature (see Hu et al. [2]).
        :param a_features: Patch_size x 2048 (Appearance_feature_size)
        a_features records the ResNet-34 feature for each object in Patch.
        :param g_features: SUM(N_i^2) x 64 (i.e. Number_of_object_pairs x Geometric_feature_size)
        g_features records the geometric features (64-D) between each pair of objects (see Hu et al. [2]). So the dimension
        is Number_of_pairs_in_images x 64 (or SUM(N_i^2) x 64). N_i is the number of objects in the i-th image.
        :param split: Batch_size x 2
        split records which batch a object belongs to.
        e.g. split = torch.tensor([[0, 5], [5, 8]]) when batch size is 2, and there are 5 objects in the first batch and
        3 objects in the second batch.
        Then the first 5 objects in the whole patch belongs to the first batch, and the rest belongs to the second batch.
        :param rel_pair_counts: (Batch_size + 1)
        rel_pair_counts records which batch a geometric feature belongs to, and gives the start and end index.
        e.g. rel_pair_counts = torch.tensor([0, 49, 113]).
        The batch size is two. The first 49 geometric features are from the first batch.
        The index begins from 0 and ends at 49. The second 64 geometric features are from the second batch.
        The index begins from 49 and ends at 113.
